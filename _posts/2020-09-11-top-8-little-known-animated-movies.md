For all the animation fans out there, I’ve compromised a list of 8 animated films who went under the radar. We all know the Hollywood blockbusters done by Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks and Sony. Great cinema hits such as Shrek, Cars, Frozen, Moana, etc. But for those out there who have seen it all, you’re in luck! This list covers only western animated movies, Japanese animation (also known as anime) will not be talked about this time.

## 9 (2009)

The movie is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humans have been eradicated by 'The Machine', a man-made device that became sentient and initiated a war against its creators. We follow 9, a rag-doll-like creature made by the same inventor of 'The Machine'. As he awakens into this post-apocalyptic world, will he be able to reclaim earth? A personal favourite, and with its short timespan you can basically watch it anytime.

## The Little Prince (2015)

To those who have already searched the depths of the Internet, this one might be familiar. The little prince is about a girl who grows up in a boring, dull world. But then she meets her neighbour; 'The Aviator'. Her neighbour introduces her to a new world, much more appealing than her own reality. The world of The Little Prince.

The Breadwinner is a drama about 11-year-old Parvana, who lives with her family in Afghanistan under the rule of the Taliban. When her father is unjustly arrested by the Taliban, she has to take care of her families financial needs in a country where women aren't even allowed outside without a man by their side.

## Song of the Sea (2014)

By the same makers as 'The Secret of Kells', this movie was sure to be beautifully animated. This movie goes about Ben and his little sister Saoirse. When their mother mysteriously disappears, they are sent out to live with their grandmother in the city. In an attempt to go home, the two siblings get drawn into a world of which they have only heard in their mother's folktales.

## The Book of Life (2014)

Despite being produced by the famous Guillermo del Toro, this animated movie slipped the masses of Hollywood when airing back in 2014. With its vivid colours and 'land of the remembered', this movie feels much like the popular Pixar movie Coco (2017). The story, however, is much different. We follow Manollo, a young man who has to choose between following his own heart, or living up to his parent's expectations. Liked the movie? Keep a watch out for its upcoming sequel.

## The Secret of Kells (2009)

We follow 12-year-old Brendan who lives in the Kells' abbey, a place surrounded by huge walls constructed to keep out plundering vikings. One day, brother Aiden, a master of illustration, visits the abbey and presents the legendary book of Kells. Brendan is chosen to finish this book, and to do so he must venture outside the walls into an enchanted forest where dangerous mythical creatures hide. There, he must find the ingredients necessary to make a special ink, so he can finish the book.

## Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart (2013)

I always find French movies to be a bit peculiar, they radiate a different vibe than the Hollywood blockbusters that we're used to. And 'Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart' is no exception. The story tells us about Jack, a boy born on the coldest day ever. When Jack gets born with a frozen heart, the midwife finds a way to save him by replacing his heart with a clock. With this condition, Jack is told that he cannot get either angry nor excited, for his clock-heart would not be able to handle such pressure. As Jack grows up, he learns about something far worse. Jack cannot fall in love with his current condition.

## April and the Extraordinary World (2015)

Yet another French film is April and the Extraordinary world. We get sucked into 19th-century France, a society that is still powered by steam and governed by Napoleon VI. Scientists vanish daily, and nobody knows why. April, a young girl, goes on a search for her missing scientist parents.
