For all the animation fans out there, I’ve compromised a list of 7 hidden animated films. We all know the Hollywood blockbusters done by Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks and Sony. Great cinema hits such as Shrek, Cars, Frozen, Moana, etc. But for those out there who have seen it all, you’re in luck! This list covers only western animated movies, Japanese animation (also known as anime) will not be talked about this time.

## 9 (2009)

The movie is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humans have been eradicated by 'The Machine', a man-made device that became sentient and initiated a war against its creators. We follow 9, a rag-doll-like creature made by thesame inventor of 'The Machine'. As he awakens into this post-apocalyptic world, will he be able to reclaim earth?

A personal favourite, and with its short timespan you can basically watch it anytime.

## The Little Prince (2015)

To those who have already searched the depths of the Internet, this one might be familiar. The little prince is about a girl who grows up in a boring, dull world. But then she meets her neighbour; 'The Aviator'. Her neighbour introduces her to a new world, much more appealing than her own reality. The world of The Little Prince.
