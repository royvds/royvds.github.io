For all the animation fans out there, I’ve compromised a list of 7 hidden animated films. We all know the Hollywood blockbusters done by Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks and Sony. Great cinema hits such as Shrek, Cars, Frozen, Moana, etc. But for those out there who have seen it all, you’re in luck! This list covers only western animated movies, Japanese animation (also known as anime) will not be talked about this time.
