title: Welcome to cTech!
---

cTech is a small blog that provides casual tech information. Anything from 'How to stay secure online' to 'Top 8 little-known animated movies'. Don't feel like digging through heaps of information? Just want some shallow information to get you going right away? Then this is the place for you. 

### Who am I?
Roy van der Steen

I'm a 20 year old software engineer student, currently following a minor English. I work part-time as a store lead for Action. I direct and instruct other Action employees during the evening shifts from 17:00 till 21:00. I have a keen interest in digital media (e.g. movies, series, anime). Ever get bored? I know a movie for that. Quarantine beating you down? There's a serie for that. Gaming? Not that much; story-driven games only. Hotel? Trivago.

tl;dr
Roy van der Steen, 20, software engineer student, Action store lead, film enthousiast & casual gamer.
